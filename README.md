# Deep Thought

This is the official documentation and implementation(s) of Deep Thought â€” language used by Deep Thought supercomputer to calculate the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

## Project structure.

| Path                          | Description                                             |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`                   | The main documentation file.                            |
| `interpreter/deep_thought.py` | The Python implementation of the Deep Thought language. |

## Deep Thought specefication.

Before the launch of the program, an array of 42,000 one-byte cells in initialized and pointer is set to a 42nd position.

Deep Thought supports seven commands:

| Command  | Description                                                                         |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `101010` | Increments the value of the current cell.                                           |
| `010101` | Decrements the value of the current cell.                                           |
| `000`    | Moves the pointer to the right.                                                     |
| `001`    | Moves the pointer to the left.                                                      |
| `100`    | Jumps to the next corresponding `111` if the value of the current cell is zero.     |
| `111`    | Jumps to previous corresponding `100` if the value of the current cell is non-zero. |
| `\n`     | Outputs the ASCII value of the current cell.                                        |

Each command is unambiguous and does represent one of the features of the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

That is because binary representation of the number `42` is `101010`, and its inverse is `010101`.
The rest of the commands are the binary representation of the dividers of 42, that is `0`, `1`, `4`, `7` (if your program can't evenly divide 42 by 4, your program is porbably is not written in Deep Thought).
